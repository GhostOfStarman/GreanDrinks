	<h1 style="text-align:center" class="grean">About Us</h1>
	
	<center><div class="abouttext">Grean is a passion project by two kids who want to create the next best matcha cafe. In the next two years, we’ll be building our brand, vendoring/appearing at pop-ups, and testing new products. Our end-goal is to open a brick-and-mortar space in 2-3 years, however, we want to learn and grow within these next few years and make some friends as we come along. 
	<br><br>
	We’re building in public and documenting our journey as we build something truly compelling. We’re glad you’re here, thank you for supporting.
	<br><br>
	<center>Cheers,</center>
